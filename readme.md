# New Project In Progress

Please forgive the horrible code. Finding examples for connecting to a database without an ORM is extremely hard when it comes to javascript. A lot of experimentation was needed. 


# FIXES TODO:

- [] Go back and update database schema for possible foreign key constraints
- [] get .env vault and use it for future projects
- [] Delete mysqltest.js and clean up backend to run seed on dev,
